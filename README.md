If your reload AP is 1, there is no reason not to press reload key every time you walk.
So this mod does exactly that. For weapons that are not grenade launcher.

By default it is on "lite mode" where it only check if weapon reload itself = 1 AP and that you have no negative reload penalty from implant/augments.

On "Full Processing Mode" - which can be enabled on MCM - it factors in weapon reload/implants/vest/servo/skills. Also this will apply vest's reload bonus to all auto-reload function to save processing power. Use this mode if you need to use Speed drive or such.


Changelog:

v1.1

Now auto loading stops when you have "damage on action" wound.

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for mode change to take effect**
